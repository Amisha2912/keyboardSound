# Keycode Keyboard

## Overview
The **Keycode Keyboard** is a web-based application that captures and displays key presses along with their key codes. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging interface for learning about keyboard events.

## Features
- **Consistent UI**: Uniform and visually appealing design with properly aligned elements.
- **Real-Time Key Display**: Shows the pressed key and its code instantly.
- **Key Combinations**: Detects and displays combinations like `Ctrl + Z`.
- **Sound Effect**: Plays a sound on each key press.
- **Key History**: Stores and displays a history of pressed keys.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: To structure the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: To handle keyboard events and update the display dynamically.

## What I Did
- Built the web page structure using HTML.
- Styled the interface for clarity and appeal.
- Added JavaScript to handle key presses, display key codes, and detect combinations.
- Included sound effects and a feature to store key history.
- Tested for consistent behavior across browsers.
